# Math for AI - Machine Learning Algorithms

Group 6 - Math for AI, AI23 @ HCMUS

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning / deep learning algorithms, including **Linear Regression**, **PCA&Clustering**, **Naive Bayes Classifier**, **CLIP**. 
The code is designed for educational purposes, providing a clear and concise understanding of the mathematical foundations and practical applications of these algorithms.

## Contents

- **Linear Regression**: Implementation of linear regression for predictive modeling.
- **PCA&Clustering**: Implementation of PCA, KMeans and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for classification tasks on Iris and ABIDE II datasets.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implementation of Bag-of-Words technique, Naive Bayes Classifier model for classification task on Enron-Spam dataset.
- **CLIP**: Explanation about CLIP - a foundation model in Vision-Language Models.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn` (PCA&Clustering)
- `transformer` (CLIP)
